# Scale-aware-Guided-and-Structure-Preserved-Texture-Filter
In this letter, a new texture filter (TF) with scale-
aware gradients and structural preservation is proposed. By
measuring the sparsity with scale-aware gradients, and structural
fidelity by H^{−1} norm with the embedded Laplacian operator,
the proposed hybrid L_{0}-H^{−1} variational model smooths noise-
corrupted small-scale textures with low/high contrast and pre-
serves sharp and prominent structures simultaneously. Qualita-
tive and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method has a significant improvement over the state-
of-the-art methods in texture filtering. Moreover, the proposed
method has fast convergence.
